        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <details>
            <summary>My childhood</summary>
            <p> I was born in the South of Ukraine near the picturesque delta of River Dnieper. I was quite a vigourous
                girl constantly challenging my friends and myself in tree climbing, racing or flipping a bike and
                playing soccer. Later on I became increadibly fascinated by the depth of sea colors and the everchanging
                mood of the sea element, and always found time spent with my family by the Black sea as the biggest
                summer adventure. </p>
